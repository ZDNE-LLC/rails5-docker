# Rails 5 docker image

This image allows you to easily develop Rails 5 app.
As Rails version 5 is still in beta, you need a custom image
to be able to use it.


## Details

Currently the image uses Rails 5 beta 3 riding Ruby 2.3.0. It will be
updated over time to always use the edge version of Rails and latest
version of Ruby.


## How to use it

TBD


## Plans

My nearest future plans are to include Postgresql image and possibly
some other images to make a full development environment ready for use.
